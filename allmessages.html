	<p>
		So honey, today it's one year since we got engaged 
		and I guess we are both sure of the decision we made 
		one year ago. I must say that I am the happiest when 
		I am with you, and although soon we have another 
		important date to celebrate, this one means a lot to 
		me. I clearly remember how sure I was of the question 
		I had to ask you. I always thought it would be much more 
		difficult, but when the time came, it seemed just natural, 
		I had no doubts and no hesitation at all. Today I feel 
		the same way, today I love you even more than one year 
		ago, and today I know that I would ask you the same 
		question over and over again, and I also know you would 
		always say YES to me.
	</p> 

	<p>
		I love you so so much my beautiful honey novia.
	</p>

		Hey honey novia mia, today is one day before our first engagement
		anniversary. I am so happy I decided to ask you to share our life. 
		It has been difficult at times, but I would not change it for 
		anything. I love waking up next to you and falling sleep hugging you.
		Those things are amazing and I only want to live them with you.
		I love you so so much, really, and I never want to be without you.
	</p> 

	<p>
		Many many kisses beautiful love of my life!	
	</p>

	<p>
		Hey honey novia mia. I know it's been a while, but I hope 
		you don't think that I don't care about you. I know 
		we need each other, and being far away from you is also 
		difficult for me. Living with you was so easy and so hard, 
		it was so easy to spend amazing time together, and so hard 
		to know that I can't be close to you every moment. I guess 
		that means I am happy with you :). I know I am a dreamer 
		bunny and that can be annoying sometimes, but I could not 
		imagine doing anything without you. It's not that I am used 
		to you, but it's like you are a part of me, a part of my 
		life and of everything I am. I couldn't be without you 
		after all we have lived together.
	</p> 

	<p>
		I love you and I miss you. Always and forever!
	</p> 
-->

<!--
	<p>
		Hey honey mia. I want to tell you that I love you more than 
		anything, and that next to you I spend the happiest moments 
		of my life. I am so happy when I wake up and see you, and 
		although many times you say I make fun of you when I repeat 
		the things you say, or copy your phrases, I do it because 
		I love you so so much, and I cannot do more than enjoy 
		every little thing you do. Really, those little things you 
		do are the cutest thing I have ever seen. So thanks to you, 
		everyday is amazing, every day I am happy, and everyday 
		I discover that you are the most amazing girl in the world 
		to me.
	</p> 

	<p>
		I love you my honey bunny novia. Sweet dreams kochanie!
	</p> 
-->
<!--
	<p>
		Hey honey mía. I know what you are going to say, 
		but better late than never. I am so happy to have you in 
		my life, and I hope I can make you as happy as you make 
		me. We have our differences, but is amazing how we can 
		be perfect in spite of that. We both are doing a lot of 
		sacrifices right now, but I am sure it will be worth 
		it one day when we have our own family and when we 
		can tell and teach our kids the few things that we 
		keep learning about life. You have really taught me a
		lot, and I am sorry for being stubborn some times, I 
		should really start listening to you more.
	</p> 

	<p>
		I love you my beautiful honey bunny ponny novia. I 
		can not wait to see you later today and give you a 
		lot lot lot of kisses. Have a good rest of the day 
		love of my life.
	</p> 
-->

<!--
	<p>
		Hey honey mía, right now I should be with you 
		but I am not. I feel terrible because of this, 
		but I cannot stop thinking about you. I don't 
		mind spending hours working, but I do mind leaving 
		alone and wasting the time that I should be spending 
		with you. I know we have to do it, but I wish we 
		would not have. You are truly the love of my life 
		and I miss you with all my heart. Not even for a 
		second I think you are in second place in my life. 
		You will forever be first, and although life puts 
		troubles in front of us, I am sure we will make 
		it. You are with me forever and I am with you 
		forever. Before you I never thought I could be 
		so sure of those words. I miss you so so much 
		tonight. I miss your hugs and your kisses, I 
		miss your voice and your smile. I miss even your 
		breath and just looking at you, just knowing that 
		you are around me.
	</p> 

	
	<p>
	        I love you so so much, and I hope this will just stop 
		happening very soon.
	</p> 
-->

<!--
	<p>
		Hey honey, when I write this to you, it's more than 6 
		months since we got engaged. I will never forget that 
		day. It was so simple and so ours. And as you always 
		tell me, it's super cool that we will be able to visit 
		the place where it happened whenever we want. I love 
		you so much and I am so happy with our decision. I know 
		life can be complicated sometimes, but there's no one 
		else with whom I would like to share it.
	</p> 

	
	<p>
	        I love you so so much my honey bunny.
	</p>

	<p>
		Hey honey, I know it has been a while since my last message 
		and there is no way I could justify that. However, I still 
		think about you all the time, and I am sure you know it, as 
		I try to show it to you in our everyday life. I enjoy spending 
		everyday with you, and for me, seeing you everyday or every 
		other week does not make a difference. I mean it in a good sense, 
		of course I am much happier when I spend time with you everyday, 
		but what I mean is that I never get tired of you. I enjoy our 
		happy and sad moments. I even enjoy our fights because I know 
		deep down we are always rock solid. As I told you last night, 
		I don't care about those little arguments, and I want you 
		to always be free to be who you are and act the way you think is 
		the best for the two of us. I really trust your opinion and 
		your points of view, I actually need you to make my life better.
	</p> 

	<p>
		I am sure I would have been fine in my life without you, but now 
		I know that the only way for me to be the happiest and to be 
		the best version of myself I could possibly ever be is with you 
		by my side. I just love you so much and I know you love me the 
		same way. 
	</p> 

	<p>
		Many kisses my honey novia!

	Hey honey novia, I guess we can say this is the fourth year we are together and 
	I cannot wait for the many more to come. First of all 
	let me tell you that I am so happy to be living with you right now. As we 
	have said in person many times, living together seems super easy and I feel 
	totally comfortable by having you around me in the house. I am sorry for 
	the times I leave the lights on :( , it's not intentional, so please don't be 
	too mad at me. Well, obviously I know it's not a big deal, but it's funny to 
	have those little home problems. They are so simple, but our life together 
	is simple. Simple but amazing.
</p> 

<p>
	This time I am saying bye in this message but soon I will see you in person,
	soon I will go to sleep and wake up with you. Soon we will go grocery 
	shopping together, and we will cook together and we will do everything 
	together. Forever together my honey bunny.
</p> 

<p>
	I LOVE YOU SO SO MUCH!
</p>

  <p>
	  Hey honey, I am sorry it has taken this long for me to write another 
	  message to you, but I have not stopped thinking about you a single day. 
	  You are truly the love of my life and I know that I could not have chosen 
	  a better person to share the rest of my life with.
  </p> 

  <p>
	  Right now I am so excited about this new stage in our life which is 
	  beginning in less than 48 hours. It will be amazing and I am sure that the 
	  best part of my life is about to begin. Wow, I cannot believe this is really 
	  happening; after waiting for over 2 years, it's finally happening. 
	  I still remember the first time I told you that I had to move, I was scared 
	  that you would not want to stay with me, but 
	  I remember you said: "maybe". That meant the world to me and I will be 
	  forever grateful that you chose to travel to the other side of the world 
	  to be with me.
  </p> 

  <p>
	  I am so proud of myself for choosing you and keeping you by my side. I am 
	  so proud to have deserved your love. I love you my honey bunny novia!

	   Happy anniversary love of my life!

	<p>
		Well honey, now we can say that we have been together for years.
		When people will ask, for how long have you been together?, we will 
		say: oh, it's been years. I really love you so so much and I am so 
		glad that I met you. The truth is that these two years have been 
		amazing, and have been so easy with you. I just feel that you are 
		my compliment and I found someone who really understands me in you.
	</p> 

	<p>
		Besides the fact that the way you are is perfect for me, I am so 
		glad to have found you because you are so hot! Really, I have the 
		whole package with you, I have my perfect girl who is soon going to 
		be my trophy wife. Yeah, I will brag about you and use you to look 
		good in front of other people. Don't blame me for that, but it's not 
		my fault that you are so beautiful.
	</p> 


	<h2> Happy anniversary again love of my life. I really really love 
	you!</h2>

	<p>
		Hey my honey novia. First time that I write to you from 
		the other side of the ocean. It's so sad and so exciting 
		to be here. It's sad because I am so far away from you, but 
		it's exciting because I know that very soon you will be here
		with me ready to start our new life together. I cannot wait 
		for us to start decorating our own home, and waking up next 
		to you everyday. Even grocery shopping will be an amazing 
		adventure because I will be with you. 
	</p> 

	<p>
		I also want to remind you that even though I am so far from 
		you, I never ever doubt that you are the love of my life. And 
		even if I cannot hug you, or speak to you, I always think of 
		you, and I always have you on my mind. I have no doubts that 
		you are and will forever be my partner, because you make me 
		feel so happy when we are together, and you always make me 
		feel better when I am sad. I feel that you always support me 
		and trust me. And that means the world to me. I will not 
		disappoint you, and I will forever be yours.
	</p> 

	<p>
		Many many kisses beautiful love of my life. I love you.

	Hey my honey novia, or should I call you my honey fianc&eacute;e now!
	I cannot believe we reached this point but I certainly know 
	that you are the perfect girl for me. It's just as simple as 
	that. I knew you were the one for me when I thought on buying 
	the ring for you and somehow it all felt so okay. You know, I 
	always thought I would be scared or I would be thinking like, 
	oh wow, my life is going to change from now on. But somehow with 
	you, I just knew it had to happen, I didn't feel like I would 
	change, or you would change. I believe that's how it has to be.
	I know we have an amazing love for each other, but the most 
	important thing about us is that we feel so comfortable with each 
	other, we don't need to make the world perfect for us to smile. 
</p> 

<p>
	I still think about Saturday, I will never forget your face. 
	You looked so happy and shocked. Like the best thing in the 
	world had just happened to you. And I am so glad that I gave 
	you that feeling, I am so happy that I can make you smile, and I 
	am so happy that I get to see you happy. You are truly the love 
	of my life, and I know it because I never ever dreamed it would 
	be like this. I cannot even express how it feels. 
</p> 

<p>
	Have a great day my beautiful life companion! Together forever.
</p> 

<p>
	I love you!

		Hey novia, we are very close to our new adventure and I 
		am so looking forward to making new memories with you. 
		Well, last weekend was also special, it was in a way the 
		first time that we were hosting the visit of someone as a 
		couple. Not exactly, but it did feel a bit like that.
	</p> 

	<p>
		Let's go back to our upcoming adventure. I know it's going 
		to be awesome and although I feel like I cannot give you 
		exactly the holiday that I wish I could, every experience 
		is great with you, whether we stay in the most comfortable 
		place in the world, or in the cheapest most simple 
		accommodation. Not that we will, but I am just saying, I 
		feel so comfortable with you that I would be happy 
		wherever we are, as long as I am with you. And I love that 
		about us. We have big dreams, but we will be happy no 
		matter what. Okay, we do have a pretty cool life now, so 
		I have nothing to complain really, but I was just saying, 
		I know I will be happy with you no matter what. Because 
		I love you with all my heart.
	</p> 

	<p>
		Many kisses my honey novia!

		Hey honey novia, almost one more month together, and 
		we are going to be together to celebrate it! I just 
		cannot believe what an amazing time we have when we 
		are together. Like you always say, we can be doing 
		nothing and somehow we don't get bored of each other.
	 	Sometimes I ask myself how could I live before you.
		How was life before I knew you, and it is something 
		that I cannot visualize any more. I really cannot 
		imagine a life in which I cannot pick up the phone 
		and text you, or call you. I cannot imagine a life 
		in which I would not wish you good night and tell 
		you good morning every single day. You are my life 
		now, and you have become the most important person 
		in my life. I miss you when you are not with me, and 
		I just love you as I did not know one could love 
		somebody.
	</p> 

	<p>
		Many kisses my honey novia.

<!--
	<p>
		Hey honey, I hope this time I can surprise you, although probably 
		you were already waiting for this message and you just didn't tell 
		me as you wanted it to come initially from me. Well, once you 
		read it, tell me if that is the case, this would be one more test 
		of how much I am getting to know you.
	</p> 

	<p>
		I thought it was quite cool as yesterday (I believe it was yesterday) 
		I was playing this game of saying things you love. It made me realize 
		how special you are to me. All your little and big things that are 
		slowly being a part of me too. In the end, I will spend the rest of 
		my life with you, so all your likes and dislikes will have an influence 
		in my life in one way or another. And I just love how much I already 
		know about you.
	</p> 

	<p>
		We have plenty of time to keep learning about each other, and I 
		am so curious to see how we will be together in 5, 10, 20, 50, ...
		years. I am sure we will have changed, but I am sure I will still 
		be by your side.
	</p> 

	<p>
		I love you honey novia mia.

	<h2> Happy one more month together honey novia! </h2> 	

	<p>
		We are definitely 
		past the year and a half now, and we are stronger than ever.
		I really enjoyed last week together, I think it gave us a 
		glimpse of how is our life going to be in the future. I must 
		say that I was the happiest knowing that I would see you every 
		night, and life at "home" with you seemed totally natural. 
	</p> 

	<p>
		I miss you today and I wish we could be like last week always. 
		I  know we will be, but sometimes I just cannot wait and I would 
		like our life together to start already now. I am really happy 
		that I have found my life partner in you, and I am sooooo looking 
		forward to our future and to all the stories that we will keep 
		collecting together.

	<p>
		Hey honey, this time I just want to thank you, I want to 
		thank you for always believing in me and supporting me, 
		even (I must admit) when I have my crazy ideas. I really 
		think I am the luckiest guy in the world for having you 
		with me, and so I try to be also the best man in the world 
		for you.
	</p> 

	<p>
		Thanks for having patience with me, and even though you give 
		me negative points sometimes, I always feel that you 
		understand me. I am sorry for the few times on which I 
		don't make you the happiest. I am grateful because from 
		all the people in the world, you are the one who was with me 
		these past few months, and you are the only one who really 
		understands how I feel, my fears and doubts. But everytime 
		I felt down, you would always be my cure, you would always 
		be the one who could make me smile, and you are the one for 
		whom I should never give up.
	</p> 


	<p>
		I love you novia, and I am so glad I have now one big story 
		in my life that I can share with you. Many many kisses. Can't 
		wait to see you tonight.

<!--

	<p>
		Hey honey novia, its a bit late, but technically I am still on time.
		Happy name day! Okay, okay, I am cheating a bit because you reminded
		me of that, but you have to know that name day was not a big deal 
		for me. I said was because it should start being important to me. 
		I guess you will always get congratulations from your mom, so I must 
		do the same, after all, from now on I want to be the one taking care 
		of you.
	</p> 

	<p>
		I like when I see you while I write, then I feel that this is 
		something that we do together. And it is ours, yours and mine, and 
		one day we will read this messages all over and laugh at how we were
		back now. I don't know how we will be in the future, but now we make
		fun of us in the past, so maybe it will be the same. You can say 
		that it is different because in the beginning we didn't know each 
		other, and although that's true, I felt comfortable with you since 
		the beginning. And even though we know each other so well right now,
		I am sure that this is nothing compared to how we will be in the 
		future. I don't know how its possible, but everyday I feel better 
		and better at your side.

		I love you my honey novia!

	Hey beautiful honey novia. I miss you today, same as I did yesterday and 
	the day before that. It's just that now it has been three days without you, 
	and even that is now too much for me.
	</p> 

	<p>
	Last weekend you were perfect again, as you always are. But even knowing how 
	perfect you are, every time I see you act the way you do, I just can not 
	believe you are real. I hope I won't be sick much often, but I know that 
	whenever I will be, you will be there to pick me up and to take care of me.
	Specially to have patience of me, listen to me and give me a kiss when I 
	most need it.
	</p> 

	<p>
	I hope I can do the same for you, I hope I can be as great to you as you are 
	to me; because trust me honey, you are the best girlfriend I could have ever 
	dreamed of. And now I go back to this continuous count that my life has turned 
	into: two more days to see you again.

		A year and a half together honey! It is amazing to see 
		how time goes by and we keep stronger than ever. I love 
		to hear your voice in my mornings, and I love how I can 
		tell you whatever I have on my mind. I guess we feel so
		good together because we are also best friends. We 
		discussed that this morning and I realized that I need 
		to create a new category, one in which you are the only 
		one there. And it's not because you are my girlfriend 
		but because I really feel you are special. You really 
		understand me, and I feel very comfortable speaking to 
		you.
	</p> 

	<p>
		I wish I could be with you now, I really enjoyed the 
		last time I spent time with your family, which in a 
		way I already feel like mine. I miss you honey, I miss 
		you so much when you are not with me. Today I just want 
		to tell you that I have no doubt you are the woman for 
		me, and I am the most fortunate man in the world to have 
		found you.

	<p>
		Hey honey novia, today I started thinking about something I told you in a 
		message. I told you that I hope you always enjoy your days, even when you 
		are not with me. I really hope so, and although I know we are the happiest 
		when we are together, I think one of the reasons why we are so great is 
		because we can be happy with ourselves, or at least we try.
	</p> 

	<p>
		I want to have an amazing life with you, but I want you to be happy without 
		me, and I think you are. Just knowing you are happy makes me happy, and I 
		assume it's the same way for you. I cannot be with you every second of 
		every day, but I can just smile every time I think of you and I know you are 
		happy, maybe also thinking about me.	
	</p> 

	<p>
		It is as they say, when you really love someone, you have to let them be 
		themselves. And I really love the way you are. I loved the way you were 
		when I first met you, and I love even more the person you are becoming by 
		my side. I hope I can help you be even happier and become an even better 
		person than the one you already are.
	</p> 

	<p>
		I love you my honey novia!

	Hey honey novia. Now we have both officially became one year older 
	together! I know getting old is sometimes not the nicest thing, 
	but imagine, we are doing it together, so every day is one more day 
	we have spent together. I just cannnot wait to see all the adventures and 
	experiences we will live through the years. The many many nights together. 
	The hundreds of dreams accomplished and the hundreds of dreams unfulfilled 
	or left unfinished. Yeah, why not, we are not suppossed to win everytime,
	but for sure we are going to have fun.
	</p> 

	<p>
	I just love you so much, and I do hope you show this to our kids someday, 
	and if you (I mean our kids) read this: know that I love your mum more 
	than anything in this world, and you should do the same.

	<h1> Happy one year and five months love of my  life!</h1>

	<p>
	  Hey honey novia, it is amazing to see how time goes by and we continue 
	  to be so happy together. One might say that one year and five months is 
	  still not that much time, and maybe problems will appear later on in our 
	  relationship, but to me, the fact that we are still so perfect for each 
	  other tells me that you are the right girl for me.
	</p>

	<p>
	  I am so happy everytime I think about the day we met. Two strangers who 
	  didn't know they had just said hi to the love of their lives. I never 
	  thought I would find you and I never thought it would be so easy when 
	  you are with the right person. But you know what? let's make it difficult, 
	  let's challenge each other every day to be even better. Make me be even 
	  better for you every single day. Ask only the best from me, and I will 
	  do the same for you. Lets make this the most amazing thing that has ever 
	  happened. 
	</p>

   	 I love you my cute perfect novia!

		Hey honey novia, I am so happy that we have met much more often in the last 
		few weeks. I am getting used to see you every weekend, and I wish I could 
		see you every day. I always miss you, even when I cannot speak with you. 
		Sometimes all I need to feel happy is to know that you are thinking about 
		me, and the best part is that I know you always do. 
	</p>

	<p>	
		I love the feeling of knowing that you are always there for me. That you 
		might be in a different place, in a different city, in a different country, 
		but still you are always with me. You have no idea how happy it makes me to 
		know that someone in the world loves me as much as you do. Thanks for being 
		such a great girlfriend and for being perfect for me.

		Many kisses my love! I love you!

	times, I cannot believe that I found someone like you. You are the best 
	person I have known. Just like me, you are not perfect, but you are perfect 
	to me and I guess that's what matters. 
	</p>

	<p>
	You know they say that we are the people we have around us, so if I have you 
	around me, I will be the best version of myself I could be. I love the way 
	you see life, how you are happy with the simple things which are the most 
	important ones. I learn a little bit about life from you everyday my love. 
	I love you my honey bunny pony novia.

	  Hey my beautiful novia. I hope you will see this in the morning so that
	  you can start your day knowing how much I love you. Not that you need 
	  to read this, as you should always know I love you and how much you mean 
	  to me.
	</p>
	<p>
	  I am soon going to fall asleep and all I can think is how much I wish I 
	  could kiss you good night. I need you, I need you in a good way, not in 
	  a desperate or unhealthy way, but I need you as much as I need to smile, 
	  I need you as a way to remind me how amazing the world is, I need you 
	  because with you I know that there is someone else in this world who is 
	  as real to me as I am real to myself. 
	  Not sure if that last phrase makes sense, but apart from me, you are the 
	  most real person in this world. The rest of people are somehow like ghosts 
	  who take part in my life, but you are special, you are a part of me who 
	  walks by my side, and sometimes I feel that I am not fully me without you.
	</p>
	<p>
	  I suppose I am tired, so that's why I am speaking of ghosts and such. But 
	  what you should get from what I said, is that you are the most important 
	  person in the world to me. I love you my honey novia!
	</p>
	<p>
	 And I almost forgot: Happy Valentine's day love of my life!
	</p>

	  Hi novia, I hope this is going to be the last week! You know what I am 
	  talking about :) . I just want you to be happy. 
	</p>
	<p>
	  Everyday I think it is one day less until we are finally together for good. 
	  Waking up next to you, sleeping next to you, and listening to you for hours 
	  speak about make up, bags and the new phone you like. Yeah, I will do that, 
	  and I cannot promise that I will listen to all the details, but I will be the 
	  one to be next to you. 
	</p>
	<p>
	  I just smile when I think of you. When I think about the times you take me 
	  shopping and I act like a kid because I am bored. Sorry for that, but it's 
	  kind of fun. You see, we are not entirely perfect, but it's those little 
	  things that makes us what we are, and to me, there could be nothing better 
	  than you and me together.
	</p>
	<p>
	  I love you my honey novia.

	<p>
	  Hey honey bunny, I miss you right now. I wish you were here with me.
	  It is kind of scary that you are getting to know me so well, now 
	  you will see the good and the bad things, and sometimes I wish you 
	  would not see the latter.
	</p>
	<p>
	  I guess that's a good thing, and it only means we are getting closer 
	  and closer every single day. You are a very important part of my life, 
	  and I love you more and more with each step we take to getting to 
	  know each other. I can't wait to speak to you later tonight.
	</p>
	<p>

          First message of our "third" year together! Okay, you know what I mean. It was another new years eve with you, and also my first Christmas 
	  with my new family! I can really imagine us having this type of Christmas year after year. We will add more people to the reunion, 
	  and we will host it some day, that will be fun.
	</p>

	<p>
	 Do you imagine how it will be once we have our own family? It will be so cool. But we will have to be careful with this thing about the 
	 wrapping paper. At least now we know that. But right now, more than the future, I am so happy about the present. My present with you 
	 is the best thing I have. My nights and mornings with you are just perfect, and having you sleeping next to me is the best feeling 
	 I have ever had.
	</p>
	<p>
	 I love you honey novia! I am looking forward to an amazing 2017 with you!
	</p>

<!--	<p>
	  Hey honey novia, one more day, one more day loving you. As you know, right now we are on a complicated situation in our personal 
	  lives. Okay, nothing really serious, but we both have something that kind of keeps us annoyed at times. I hope we will not have 
	  to deal with stuff like this too often, but I am happy that we can also share our worries and concerns when we have them. It is really 
	  amazing to have you by my side and be able to tell when I am scared, and to hear you when you are stressed or worried about what 
	  to do in your life.
	</p>
	<p>
	  The fact that we trust each other so much just makes me see one more time that you are also my best friend. And you know what, I am so 
	  happy that I will be able to wake up everyday with my best friend. I feel that you are the first person I want to talk to when 
	  I have doubts and also the first person I want to share my happiness with. I just love you in the best possible way.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Many kisses best friend.
	</p>

<!--
	<p> Now it's official, more than one year together. Even today it's more than one year since our first kiss.</p>

	<p>It is impossible for me to just put in words all what you mean to me. It has been an amazing year and you have taught me 
	so so much about myself and about being in a great relationship. Well, it's even perfect and that is what surprises me the
	most. I didn't think it could exist something like this, and see how after one year we are even closer and stronger than ever 
	only makes me dream about all the life that we have ahead of us.
	</p>

	<p>You are really the love of my life. Many people look for something like what we have, so we should be thankful and happy 
	that we found each other. Let us build the most amazing life together. <a href=loveyou.html>And you know what honey?</a>

Hola novia, esta vez decid&#237 escribirte en espa&#241ol. La siguiente frase deber&#237as entenderla f&#225cilmente:
</p>

<p>
Eres lo m&#225s maravilloso que me pas&#243 en esta vida.
</p>

<p>
Todav&#237a me parece incre&#237ble como empez&#243 nuestra historia. Empez&#243 aqu&#237 en mi departamento, un d&#237a solamente llegaste
y me cautivaste con tu sonrisa, con esa risa que hasta ahora me hace enamorarme m&#225s cada vez que la escucho. Me acuerdo 
que ve&#237as una pel&#237cula y yo solo escuchaba como te re&#237as. Yo pensaba, "me encanta su manera de re&#237r". Y en esos primeros d&#237as me di 
cuenta que te encanta re&#237r, que eres una persona feliz y eso es algo que siempre he admirado de ti. Para m&#237 eres perfecta, 
no solo porque somos muy parecidos, pero tambi&#233n porque tienes cosas que yo no, porque en muchos aspectos quisiera ser 
como t&#250, y poque s&#233 que contigo en mi vida voy a llegar a ser el mejor hombre que puedo ser.
</p>

<p>
Te amo amor de mi vida
</p>

<p>
  Hey bunny, yeah, I had to use it as you said I would. Only 2 weeks left until we can finally say we have known each other for more than one year. It has been
  such a great time with you. 
</p>

<p>
  I have to say that the most incredible part of my time with you is discovering
  how well we understand each other. Even when we argue I somehow feel that we are 
  still connected with the same goal in mind. I cannot believe that I found someone so 
  compatible with me as you are. So I am really not lying when I say that we are
   perfect. And you know what, you think the same, which comes to show how great
    we are together.
</p>


<p>
  I also love you today honey novia!
</p>

<!--

<p>
  Hey honey novia, today its eleven months since the day we met, and I am so happy to have you in my life. I thought I could remind 
  you about one of our great weekends, I am sure if you look at the photo you will know what weekend it was.
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <img src="images/20160410_180629.jpg" alt="Pink tulips" style="width:405px;height:304px;"> </p>

 

<p>
  I really cannot wait for more weekends like that together, in many different parts of the world. If it is up me, I would go 
  everywhere with you, but I know you don't like some of the cold places I would like to visit; still, wherever I go I am always 
  thinking of you. And for the rest of places; the ones that we will see together, you can always count with a kiss everytime you 
  blink. I love you honey novia.
</p>

<!--
<p>
  Good morning my honey novia. This morning I woke up and I knew I had dreamed about you, I cannot remember what was it about, but 
  I just knew you had been in my mind. It's funny how you keep getting deeper and deeper into my mind as time goes by. Eventhough 
  I already made up my mind about you months ago, you become more important to me every day and every night. There is no longer a me without 
  you, and that's the way it has to be.
</p>

<p>
  I love you this morning and I will love you this evening. That's the sentence I will repeat every day from now on. Many kisses 
  my honey novia!
</p>
-->

<!--
<p>
  Hey honey novia, now it's only 3 days to see you again and you have no idea how happy I am and how much I miss you. I was just now thinking on how much 
  I love your laugh. I think I have told you many times that I loved 
  your laugh since the first time I heard it. I still remember because I was not by your side back then, but eventhough I didn't know you, 
  I wished I could be there with you, laugh with you, and kiss you. Yes honey novia, I wanted to kiss you since the first night I met you.
</p>

<p>
  Luckily for me, now I hear it everyday, and even several times per day. I love how I hear you laugh when I wake up and how you seem so 
  happy at night before you go to sleep and wish me good night. So just keep laughing and keep laughing with me. That makes me the happiest guy 
  in the world. I love you honey novia!
</p>

-->

<!--
<p>
Hey honey novia, tonight I just want to tell you that I love you. I really really do, and I really want to believe that this is the most special thing in the world.
At least that's how it feels to me. I am not perfect, and you are not either, but I will do my best to make our life together perfect. Please do the same for me.
</p>

<p>
I know we deserve to have the best life, a life we could only have dreamed of. With ups and downs, sure, I hope with not so many bad things, but no matter what, if we are together, we will always have a perfect life.
I do hope life will also give us good things, after all, there are things which are not up to us. But I have hope, I have hope in us.
</p>

<p>
I love you with all my heart!
</p>

-->

<!--
<p>
Good morning honey novia! Finally I post sometthing for you again. After two weekends with you I could not be happier with my life. Everytime I spend time with you I realize how great we will be together and I am more and more convinced that we are perfect for each other. I can not wait for the day in which I will not have to wait weeks or days to see you. 
</p>

<p>
I am so excited about our perfect life together, because with you, no matter what, life is perfect. I love you honey novia!
</p>

<!--
<p>
  This time the message is inspired by a phrase you just said to me as I began to write this new entry. You said: don't loose me. Of course I do not plan to loose you 
  my honey novia. You are the best thing in the world to me and I want to have you always close to me. I know you say it as a joke everytime my phone falls off as we speak on skype 
  and I hope that's the only time you will say it. I love you with all my heart and as we always say: you are stuck with me, so, no novia, I am not going to loose you, not 
  today, not ever.
</p>
-->

<!--

<p>
Hey honey novia. You know they say that the best relationships are the ones where both people tell each other what they think.
I love when you remind me about these messages, and the fact that sometimes it might take me a bit longer to write them, does not mean I have forgotten about you, but I love when you ask me about your message.
I do not mind that you do and I hope you do not mind doing it. I hope you always ask me to do nice things for you. I will do them with or without you telling me, but it is great to know that you 
will not let me not make you happy. And making you happy makes me simply the happiest guy in the world.
</p>

<p>
I love you my honey novia.
</p>
-->

<!--

<p>
Now it has been a few days since my last message, but the fact that I was busy does not mean I stopped thinking of you.
Besides, I got to see you over the weekend and if I am completely honest with you, I have the best days of my life everytime I am with you. 
So I have come to the conclusion that every day that I am with you is the best day of my life. Thanks for making my days and my life so amazing.
</p>

<p>
Many kisses my honey novia.
</p>
-->

<!--

<p> 
One more day,one more message, not sure that I will be able to post something here every day, but as long as I can, why not do it.
What I can do is try to talk to you every single day, at least one "Hi honey novia", but don't leave you one day without hearing from me.
Okay, it might be that at some point I will be in some crazy place and I can't talk to you, so that's why I should take advantage of every time I can.
My plan is for you to never forget how I feel about you. Not one single day, because every single day I am loving you. 

I love you today honey novia.
</p>
-->

<!-- My first message and I wonder what to say.
I told you it would not be easy, so many things I could tell and so many that I already have.
I could tell you that today I woke up and thought about you, but you probably know that already. Hmm, what if I tell you that I dreamed about you last night.
Too obvious too. What about the fact that I am thinking about you right now (again too obvious).
I know! what is not so obvious is that one week from now, one month from now, one year from now, and hopefully 20 years from now I will still wake up and think about you.
I will still dream about you and I will still think about you when I will send you a message to tell you how I feel about you.*/

/*Have a good day my honey novia.*/ -->
