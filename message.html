	Hey my honey novia, or should I call you my honey fianc&eacute;e now!
	I cannot believe we reached this point but I certainly know 
	that you are the perfect girl for me. It's just as simple as 
	that. I knew you were the one for me when I thought on buying 
	the ring for you and somehow it all felt so okay. You know, I 
	always thought I would be scared or I would be thinking like, 
	oh wow, my life is going to change from now on. But somehow with 
	you, I just knew it had to happen, I didn't feel like I would 
	change, or you would change. I believe that's how it has to be.
	I know we have an amazing love for each other, but the most 
	important thing about us is that we feel so comfortable with each 
	other, we don't need to make the world perfect for us to smile. 
</p> 

<p>
	I still think about Saturday, I will never forget your face. 
	You looked so happy and shocked. Like the best thing in the 
	world had just happened to you. And I am so glad that I gave 
	you that feeling, I am so happy that I can make you smile, and I 
	am so happy that I get to see you happy. You are truly the love 
	of my life, and I know it because I never ever dreamed it would 
	be like this. I cannot even express how it feels. 
</p> 

<p>
	Have a great day my beautiful life companion! Together forever.
</p> 

<p>
	I love you!
