		Hey honey novia, its a bit late, but technically I am still on time.
		Happy name day! Okay, okay, I am cheating a bit because you reminded
		me of that, but you have to know that name day was not a big deal 
		for me. I said was because it should start being important to me. 
		I guess you will always get congratulations from your mom, so I must 
		do the same, after all, from now on I want to be the one taking care 
		of you.
	</p> 

	<p>
		I like when I see you while I write, then I feel that this is 
		something that we do together. And it is ours, yours and mine, and 
		one day we will read this messages all over and laugh at how we were
		back now. I don't know how we will be in the future, but now we make
		fun of us in the past, so maybe it will be the same. You can say 
		that it is different because in the beginning we didn't know each 
		other, and although that's true, I felt comfortable with you since 
		the beginning. And even though we know each other so well right now,
		I am sure that this is nothing compared to how we will be in the 
		future. I don't know how its possible, but everyday I feel better 
		and better at your side.
	</p> 

	<p>
		I love you my honey novia!
