	<p>
	  Hey my beautiful novia. I hope you will see this in the morning so that
	  you can start your day knowing how much I love you. Not that you need 
	  to read this, as you should always know I love you and how much you mean 
	  to me.
	</p>
	<p>
	  I am soon going to fall asleep and all I can think is how much I wish I 
	  could kiss you good night. I need you, I need you in a good way, not in 
	  a desperate or unhealthy way, but I need you as much as I need to smile, 
	  I need you as a way to remind me how amazing the world is, I need you 
	  because with you I know that there is someone else in this world who is 
	  as real to me as I am real to myself. 
	  Not sure if that last phrase makes sense, but apart from me, you are the 
	  most real person in this world. The rest of people are somehow like ghosts 
	  who take part in my life, but you are special, you are a part of me who 
	  walks by my side, and sometimes I feel that I am not fully me without you.
	</p>
	<p>
	  I suppose I am tired, so that's why I am speaking of ghosts and such. But 
	  what you should get from what I said, is that you are the most important 
	  person in the world to me. I love you my honey novia!
	</p>
	<p>
	 And I almost forgot: Happy Valentine's day love of my life!
	</p>
