		Hey honey wifey novia mia! Finally another message. 
		I am sorry it took so long, I am a bit lazy, but I 
		do love you every day and my love for you only grows 
		stronger. Now we are more than 6 months married, and 
		although it's still not much time, it's really cool 
		to see how our time together keeps increasing and 
		increasing. I want to live my life with you for 
		many many more years, and be so happy as I am right 
		now. 
	</p> 

	<p>
		I love you so so much! Many kisses love of my life!
