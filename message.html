		Hey honey, I know it has been a while since my last message 
		and there is no way I could justify that. However, I still 
		think about you all the time, and I am sure you know it, as 
		I try to show it to you in our everyday life. I enjoy spending 
		everyday with you, and for me, seeing you everyday or every 
		other week does not make a difference. I mean it in a good sense, 
		of course I am much happier when I spend time with you everyday, 
		but what I mean is that I never get tired of you. I enjoy our 
		happy and sad moments. I even enjoy our fights because I know 
		deep down we are always rock solid. As I told you last night, 
		I don't care about those little arguments, and I want you 
		to always be free to be who you are and act the way you think is 
		the best for the two of us. I really trust your opinion and 
		your points of view, I actually need you to make my life better.
	</p> 

	<p>
		I am sure I would have been fine in my life without you, but now 
		I know that the only way for me to be the happiest and to be 
		the best version of myself I could possibly ever be is with you 
		by my side. I just love you so much and I know you love me the 
		same way. 
	</p> 

	<p>
		Many kisses my honey novia!
