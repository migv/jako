		Hey honey novia mia. I was just thinking about the 
		amazing history that we are building together, and I want you 
		to know that I am really excited 
		about the things that are about to 
		happen. Very soon I won't be able to call you novia anymore, 
		which makes me think: what do we do with this site? Hmm, 
		although we will keep it, the title would be a bit confusing.
	</p> 

	<p>
		I know I am not perfect, but trust me, I will try to be 
		the better version of myself for you, to make you as 
		happy as you deserve to be.
	</p> 

	<p>
		Many many kisses kochanie! I love you!
