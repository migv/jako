		Hey cute wifey bunny. It is such a pity that I cannot hug you now 
		because 
		you are far away from me, but I always miss you and think about you. 
		I cannot wait to have you in my arms again and be able to speak with 
		you in person and give you many kisses. Right now it's only a little 
		over than 2 weeks for us to meet again and I am so happy that soon 
		I will be able to spend 
		time with my favourite person in the world!
	</p> 

	<p>
		Also, we are soon starting a new adventure (I hope so), and I could 
		not ask for a better partner. You are just amazing and the perfect 
		fit for me. I am sure that nobody would understand me the way you 
		do. I love you my honey bunny.

		Many kisses honey novia.
