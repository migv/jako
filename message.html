		Hey my honey novia. First time that I write to you from 
		the other side of the ocean. It's so sad and so exciting 
		to be here. It's sad because I am so far away from you, but 
		it's exciting because I know that very soon you will be here
		with me ready to start our new life together. I cannot wait 
		for us to start decorating our own home, and waking up next 
		to you everyday. Even grocery shopping will be an amazing 
		adventure because I will be with you. 
	</p> 

	<p>
		I also want to remind you that even though I am so far from 
		you, I never ever doubt that you are the love of my life. And 
		even if I cannot hug you, or speak to you, I always think of 
		you, and I always have you on my mind. I have no doubts that 
		you are and will forever be my partner, because you make me 
		feel so happy when we are together, and you always make me 
		feel better when I am sad. I feel that you always support me 
		and trust me. And that means the world to me. I will not 
		disappoint you, and I will forever be yours.
	</p> 

	<p>
		Many many kisses beautiful love of my life. I love you.
