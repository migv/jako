		Happy 6 years together beautiful love of my life!
	</p> 

	<p>
		A lot has passed this last year! We started our own 
		family, can you believe it? It has been difficult but 
		also full of amazing moments and I am forever grateful
		for your love every day, you make me the happiest guy
		in the world and I could not imagine living all these
		experiences with anybody else. You are perfect for me!
	</p>

		It is so strange to think 6 years ago I still did not 
		know you, I just knew about you and had seen some 
		photos, but I still had not met the mother of my son
		in person. Now you are part of my every day and my 
		every night. I really love our time together and our 
		little dates whenever we have the time time for them.
		I should be better with spending those special moments
		with you, not only because you deserve it, but also 
		because I enjoy it. I am truly the happiest when I am
		with you. I am sorry for those moments when I seem 
		annoyed or tired, I really would not spend my days 
		with anybody else but you.

		Okay, now some words about our boy! He is the cutest, 
		but what could we expect when he has the most beautiful
		mother in the world. I love his smile and I love how 
		he interacts with us. We made a person together! He is 
		a little bit crazy and annoying at times, but whenever 
		he gives us a giant smile or laugh I know we just melt.
		You are an amazing mother, you have been from day one 
		with him so you should never doubt on how amazing you 
		are; seriously, to think that you came back home the 
		day after, and you immediately were the perfect  mother 
		is just amazing. I love our boy, because he is ours and 
		he is a part of you and me, because I see a part of you
		in him and I just remember how lucky I am to have met 
		you on this day 6 years ago.

	<p>
		I love you so so much, and I want to be always and 
		forever with you!
