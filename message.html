		Hey honey wifey! Can you believe how far along we have come?
		It seems super cool to already have found the love of my life, 
		you know, this person that you dream you are going to meet 
		one day. Perhaps you did not think about it, but I certainly 
		did. I kind of always thought I was going to meet my princess
		and finally I did. Not that this is the only reason why I 
		chose you, but you are my blue eyed princess!!
	</p> 

	<p>
		It's really rare that dreams come true, but you became a 
		reality and I guess you always were, you were just waiting 
		to meet me. I also feel I am super special to you, and 
		considering how picky you are, the fact that you decided 
		to say YES to me, simply means that we are the right 
		choice for one another. I hope you will always feel so 
		proud of saying YES as I feel right now.
	</p> 

	<p>
		I love you my blue eyed queenie bunny!
