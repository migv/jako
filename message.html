	Hey beautiful honey novia. I miss you today, same as I did yesterday and 
	the day before that. It's just that now it has been three days without you, 
	and even that is now too much for me.
	</p> 

	<p>
	Last weekend you were perfect again, as you always are. But even knowing how 
	perfect you are, every time I see you act the way you do, I just can not 
	believe you are real. I hope I won't be sick much often, but I know that 
	whenever I will be, you will be there to pick me up and to take care of me.
	Specially to have patience of me, listen to me and give me a kiss when I 
	most need it.
	</p> 

	<p>
	I hope I can do the same for you, I hope I can be as great to you as you are 
	to me; because trust me honey, you are the best girlfriend I could have ever 
	dreamed of. And now I go back to this continuous count that my life has turned 
	into: two more days to see you again.
	</p> 

	<p>
	I love you my honey bunny novia!
	</p>
