	<h2> Happy one more month together honey novia! </h2> 	

	<p>
		We are definitely 
		past the year and a half now, and we are stronger than ever.
		I really enjoyed last week together, I think it gave us a 
		glimpse of how is our life going to be in the future. I must 
		say that I was the happiest knowing that I would see you every 
		night, and life at "home" with you seemed totally natural. 
	</p> 

	<p>
		I miss you today and I wish we could be like last week always. 
		I  know we will be, but sometimes I just cannot wait and I would 
		like our life together to start already now. I am really happy 
		that I have found my life partner in you, and I am sooooo looking 
		forward to our future and to all the stories that we will keep 
		collecting together.
	</p> 

	<p>
		I love you my honey novia!
