	  Hey honey, I am sorry it has taken this long for me to write another 
	  message to you, but I have not stopped thinking about you a single day. 
	  You are truly the love of my life and I know that I could not have chosen 
	  a better person to share the rest of my life with.
  </p> 

  <p>
	  Right now I am so excited about this new stage in our life which is 
	  beginning in less than 48 hours. It will be amazing and I am sure that the 
	  best part of my life is about to begin. Wow, I cannot believe this is really 
	  happening; after waiting for over 2 years, it's finally happening. 
	  I still remember the first time I told you that I had to move, I was scared 
	  that you would not want to stay with me, but 
	  I remember you said: "maybe". That meant the world to me and I will be 
	  forever grateful that you chose to travel to the other side of the world 
	  to be with me.
  </p> 

  <p>
	  I am so proud of myself for choosing you and keeping you by my side. I am 
	  so proud to have deserved your love. I love you my honey bunny novia!
  </p>
