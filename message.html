		Happy 4 years together honey novia wifey mia!
	</p> 

	<p>
		It's amazing how we keep loving each other so much 
		after this time. It's as if we just started dating. 
		I still feel this incredible feeling when I see you 
		and when I kiss you. It's been 4 years, but in many 
		ways it is as if we are starting and getting to know 
		each other every single day.
	</p> 

	<p>
		I love you so much and I just can't wait for many more 
		years together. And as we always say, we have a super 
		cool story, so we should continue making it as amazing 
		as it has been so far.
	</p> 

	<p>
		Many kisses my wifey bunny!
