		Hey honey guapa!
	</p> 

	<p>
		Can you believe its 7 years already! Its amazing! We 
		keep making more and more memories, we keep building our
		incredible life together. I just think whatever we live
		together is amazing, because you are for me and I am 
		for you.
	</p>

	<p>
		7 years ago we had one of those moments in life that we will never
		forget. A simple 'hi' that we will forever remember. A single 
		moment when our life changed forever and a point in time that
		defined the future for us.
	</p> 
	
	<p>
		I love you so so much and after all this time I still think
		you are the perfect one for me. You just understand me, put up 
		with me, give me a lot of love and are the cutest of them all.
		I have everything I need and I cannot believe how happy I am. 
		Life with you its easy but joyful. I just know you are my one
		and I am for you. Even when we fight I always feel we are 
		perfect for each other.
	</p> 

	<p>
		Now that its 7 years we also have a new life to celebrate, our
		family keeps growing and I cannot wait to meet the new one 
		to come. A new cutie bunny for us :) .Plus, its amazing how 
		compatible we are at everything ;). Just one more proof we 
		are meant for each other.
	</p> 

	<p>
		I love you so very much beautiful bunny! I love every moment 
		with you and I am so proud to be your husband and the father 
		to your children. For many more years to come. Always together, 
		always and forever.
	</p>
