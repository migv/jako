		Hey honey m√≠a, right now I should be with you 
		but I am not. I feel terrible because of this, 
		but I cannot stop thinking about you. I don't 
		mind spending hours working, but I do mind leaving 
		alone and wasting the time that I should be spending 
		with you. I know we have to do it, but I wish we 
		would not have. You are truly the love of my life 
		and I miss you with all my heart. Not even for a 
		second I think you are in second place in my life. 
		You will forever be first, and although life puts 
		troubles in front of us, I am sure we will make 
		it. You are with me forever and I am with you 
		forever. Before you I never thought I could be 
		so sure of those words. I miss you so so much 
		tonight. I miss your hugs and your kisses, I 
		miss your voice and your smile. I miss even your 
		breath and just looking at you, just knowing that 
		you are around me.
	</p> 

	
	<p>
	        I love you so so much, and I hope this will just stop 
		happening very soon.
	</p>
