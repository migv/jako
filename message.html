		Hey honey, this time I just want to thank you, I want to 
		thank you for always believing in me and supporting me, 
		even (I must admit) when I have my crazy ideas. I really 
		think I am the luckiest guy in the world for having you 
		with me, and so I try to be also the best man in the world 
		for you.
	</p> 

	<p>
		Thanks for having patience with me, and even though you give 
		me negative points sometimes, I always feel that you 
		understand me. I am sorry for the few times on which I 
		don't make you the happiest. I am grateful because from 
		all the people in the world, you are the one who was with me 
		these past few months, and you are the only one who really 
		understands how I feel, my fears and doubts. But everytime 
		I felt down, you would always be my cure, you would always 
		be the one who could make me smile, and you are the one for 
		whom I should never give up.
	</p> 


	<p>
		I love you novia, and I am so glad I have now one big story 
		in my life that I can share with you. Many many kisses. Can't 
		wait to see you tonight.
	</p>
