		Hey honey novia, or should I call you honey wife. It finally 
		happened! I know we knew this was going to happen, but it's totally real now.
		It is only a couple of days, and although I can always see something has 
		changed (looking at my finger), to me, it feels just as awesome as 
		it was only a week ago. I guess the main difference is that now the 
		rest of the world can see this is completely official and that we are 
		totally committed to one another. Yeah, it's going to be funny to 
		introduce you as my wife. It sounds like we are getting old, haha. 
	</p> 

	<p>
		I want you to know that I am completely confident that I made the best 
		decision, and I could not imagine anybody else to spend the 
		rest of my life with.
	</p> 

	<p>
		I love you wifey bunny!
