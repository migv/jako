		Hey honey novia mia, today is one day before our first engagement
		anniversary. I am so happy I decided to ask you to share our life. 
		It has been difficult at times, but I would not change it for 
		anything. I love waking up next to you and falling sleep hugging you.
		Those things are amazing and I only want to live then with you.
		I love you so so much, really, and I never want to be without you.
	</p> 

	<p>
		Many many kisses beautiful love of my life!
