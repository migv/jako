		Hey honey m√≠a. I know what you are going to say, 
		but better late than never. I am so happy to have you in 
		my life, and I hope I can make you as happy as you make 
		me. We have our differences, but is amazing how we can 
		be perfect in spite of that. We both are doing a lot of 
		sacrifices right now, but I am sure it will be worth 
		it one day when we have our own family and when we 
		can tell and teach our kids the few things that we 
		keep learning about life. You have really taught me a
		lot, and I am sorry for being stubborn some times, I 
		should really start listening to you more.
	</p> 

	<p>
		I love you my beautiful honey bunny ponny novia. I 
		can not wait to see you later today and give you a 
		lot lot lot of kisses. Have a good rest of the day 
		love of my life.
