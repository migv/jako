		A year and a half together honey! It is amazing to see 
		how time goes by and we keep stronger than ever. I love 
		to hear your voice in my mornings, and I love how I can 
		tell you whatever I have on my mind. I guess we feel so
		good together because we are also best friends. We 
		discussed that this morning and I realized that I need 
		to create a new category, one in which you are the only 
		one there. And it's not because you are my girlfriend 
		but because I really feel you are special. You really 
		understand me, and I feel very comfortable speaking to 
		you.

		I wish I could be with you now, I really enjoyed the 
		last time I spent time with your family, which in a 
		way I already feel like mine. I miss you honey, I miss 
		you so much when you are not with me. Today I just want 
		to tell you that I have no doubt you are the woman for 
		me, and I am the most fortunate man in the world to have 
		found you.

	<p>
		I love you my amazing and incredible honey novia!
