		Three years ago, just a few hours before  the most important moment of my life!
		I could not have imagined what you would become for me. I just 
		saw that beautiful girl with blue eyes and black hair who told me a name 
		I forgot the next day. How could I imagine that girl would be about to 
		become my wife? I was so lucky to have had the opportunity to know you. 
		My life would never get to be as happy if I would not have met you.

	</p> 

	<p>
		I really love our story, our first few days together, getting to know 
		each other without knowing what to expect. I could tell from the 
		beginning we were interested in each other. At least I was, and I remember 
		thinking about how would I ask you to spend some time with me, just the 
		two of us. I was scared you might not accept, but I felt you also enjoyed 
		our conversations. Oh honey, such a cool scary funny moments.
	</p> 

	<p>
		Three years later and I get to spend almost everyday with you. I love 
		you so so much my beautiful honey novia.
	</p> 

	<p>
		Many many kisses amor de mi vida!
