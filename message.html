		Hey honey, when I write this to you, it's more than 6 
		months since we got engaged. I will never forget that 
		day. It was so simple and so ours. And as you always 
		tell me, it's super cool that we will be able to visit 
		the place where it happened whenever we want. I love 
		you so much and I am so happy with our decision. I know 
		life can be complicated sometimes, but there's no one 
		else with whom I would like to share it.

	        I love you so so much my honey bunny.
