		Hey honey novia, I am so happy that we have met much more often in the last 
		few weeks. I am getting used to see you every weekend, and I wish I could 
		see you every day. I always miss you, even when I cannot speak with you. 
		Sometimes all I need to feel happy is to know that you are thinking about 
		me, and the best part is that I know you always do. 
	</p>

	<p>	
		I love the feeling of knowing that you are always there for me. That you 
		might be in a different place, in a different city, in a different country, 
		but still you are always with me. You have no idea how happy it makes me to 
		know that someone in the world loves me as much as you do. Thanks for being 
		such a great girlfriend and for being perfect for me.
	</p>

	<p>	
		Many kisses my love! I love you!
