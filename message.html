		Hey honey, I hope this time I can surprise you, although probably 
		you were already waiting for this message and you just didn't tell 
		me as you wanted it to come initially from me. Well, once you 
		read it, tell me if that is the case, this would be one more test 
		of how much I am getting to know you.
	</p> 

	<p>
		I thought it was quite cool as yesterday (I believe it was yesterday) 
		I was playing this game of saying things you love. It made me realize 
		how special you are to me. All your little and big things that are 
		slowly being a part of me too. In the end, I will spend the rest of 
		my life with you, so all your likes and dislikes will have an influence 
		in my life in one way or another. And I just love how much I already 
		know about you.
	</p> 

	<p>
		We have plenty of time to keep learning about each other, and I 
		am so curious to see how we will be together in 5, 10, 20, 50, ...
		years. I am sure we will have changed, but I am sure I will still 
		be by your side.
	</p> 

	<p>
		I love you honey novia mia.
