		Well honey, now we can say that we have been together for years.
		When people will ask, for how long have you been together?, we will 
		say: oh, it's been years. I really love you so so much and I am so 
		glad that I met you. The truth is that these two years have been 
		amazing, and have been so easy with you. I just feel that you are 
		my compliment and I found someone who really understands me in you.
	</p> 

	<p>
		Besides the fact that the way you are is perfect for me, I am so 
		glad to have found you because you are so hot! Really, I have the 
		whole package with you, I have my perfect girl who is soon going to 
		be my trophy wife. Yeah, I will brag about you and use you to look 
		good in front of other people. Don't blame me for that, but it's not 
		my fault that you are so beautiful.
	</p>
