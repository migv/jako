		Hey honey novia, almost one more month together, and 
		we are going to be together to celebrate it! I just 
		cannot believe what an amazing time we have when we 
		are together. Like you always say, we can be doing 
		nothing and somehow we don't get bored of each other.
	 	Sometimes I ask myself how could I live before you.
		How was life before I knew you, and it is something 
		that I cannot visualize any more. I really cannot 
		imagine a life in which I cannot pick up the phone 
		and text you, or call you. I cannot imagine a life 
		in which I would not wish you good night and tell 
		you good morning every single day. You are my life 
		now, and you have become the most important person 
		in my life. I miss you when you are not with me, and 
		I just love you as I did not know one could love 
		somebody.
	</p> 

	<p>
		Many kisses my honey novia.
