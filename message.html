		Hey beautiful love of my life!
	</p> 

	<p>
		I know it always takes me way to long to write one of 
		these, but I never forget about you, and I always want 
		to make you happy! I guess just as happy as you make 
		me. Maybe I am not the best at showing you, but I could 
		not live my life with anybody else, you are just perfect 
		for me!
	</p> 
	
	<p>
		It has been difficult to spend time the two of us lately,
		and I cannot wait until we regain back some of the time 
		to spend between the two of us. I want to just hug you, 
		kiss you and just tell you how much I love you. But I 
		know we just need to be patient, and although it is very 
		difficult, the journey we are going through with our 
		boy is one of the most amazing challenges we could have 
		in our lives.
	</p> 

	<p>
		I will try to always be there for the both of you, and try 
		to be the best husband and father. I will always be there 
		to help you and whenever you feel tired, remember you are 
		never alone and I am by your side to support you.
	</p> 

	<p>
		I love you so very much beautiful bunny!
	</p>
