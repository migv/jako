		Happy 5 years together love of my life!
	</p> 

	<p>
		A little late with the message, but I hope you know 
		that I am always thinking about you and that there's 
		no other person in this world that I would want to 
		spend my life with. Specially now with this crazy 
		world, I am happy that I can be with you every day. 
		You are my bubble!
	</p> 
	
	<p>
		You have also made me the happiest guy in the world 
		now that we are waiting for the little dude! We keep 
		adding more pieces to our story and this is a very 
		special one. This is completely ours, from scratch a 
		combination of you and me.

	</p> 

	<p>
		He is definitely a 
		super lucky boy to have you, and I know you will be 
		amazing because you already are amazing to me. I 
		am so proud to call you my wife and build my life 
		with you.
	</p> 

	<p>
		I love you so so much love of my life!
