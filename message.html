	Hey honey novia, I guess we can say this is the fourth year we are together and 
	I cannot wait for the many more to come. First of all 
	let me tell you that I am so happy to be living with you right now. As we 
	have said in person many times, living together seems super easy and I feel 
	totally comfortable by having you around me in the house. I am sorry for 
	the times I leave the lights on :( , it's not intentional, so please don't be 
	too mad at me. Well, obviously I know it's not a big deal, but it's funny to 
	have those little home problems. They are so simple, but our life together 
	is simple. Simple but amazing.
</p> 

<p>
	This time I am saying bye in this message but soon I will see you in person,
	soon I will go to sleep and wake up with you. Soon we will go grocery 
	shopping together, and we will cook together and we will do everything 
	together. Forever together my honey bunny.
</p> 

<p>
	I LOVE YOU SO SO MUCH!
</p>
