		Hey honey novia, today I started thinking about something I told you in a 
		message. I told you that I hope you always enjoy your days, even when you 
		are not with me. I really hope so, and although I know we are the happiest 
		when we are together, I think one of the reasons why we are so great is 
		because we can be happy with ourselves, or at least we try.
	</p> 

	<p>
		I want to have an amazing life with you, but I want you to be happy without 
		me, and I think you are. Just knowing you are happy makes me happy, and I 
		assume it's the same way for you. I cannot be with you every second of 
		every day, but I can just smile every time I think of you and I know you are 
		happy, maybe also thinking about me.	
	</p> 

	<p>
		It is as they say, when you really love someone, you have to let them be 
		themselves. And I really love the way you are. I loved the way you were 
		when I first met you, and I love even more the person you are becoming by 
		my side. I hope I can help you be even happier and become an even better 
		person than the one you already are.
	</p> 

	<p>
		I love you my honey novia!
