		So honey, today it's one year since we got engaged 
		and I guess we are both sure of the decision we made 
		one year ago. I must say that I am the happiest when 
		I am with you, and although soon we have another 
		important date to celebrate, this one means a lot to 
		me. I clearly remember how sure I was of the question 
		I had to ask you. I always thought it would be much more 
		difficult, but when the time came, it seemed just natural, 
		I had no doubts and no hesitation at all. Today I feel 
		the same way, today I love you even more than one year 
		ago, and today I know that I would ask you the same 
		question over and over again, and I also know you would 
		always say YES to me.
	</p> 

	<p>
		I love you so so much my beautiful honey novia.
