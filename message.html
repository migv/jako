	Hey honey novia. Now we have both officially became one year older 
	together! I know getting old is sometimes not the nicest thing, 
	but imagine, we are doing it together, so every day is one more day 
	we have spent together. I just cannnot wait to see all the adventures and 
	experiences we will live through the years. The many many nights together. 
	The hundreds of dreams accomplished and the hundreds of dreams unfulfilled 
	or left unfinished. Yeah, why not, we are not suppossed to win everytime,
	but for sure we are going to have fun.
	</p> 

	<p>
	I just love you so much, and I do hope you show this to our kids someday, 
	and if you (I mean our kids) read this: know that I love your mum more 
	than anything in this world, and you should do the same.
	</p> 

	<p>
	Many kisses my beautiful honey novia.
