		Hey honey mia. I want to tell you that I love you more than 
		anything, and that next to you I spend the happiest moments 
		of my life. I am so happy when I wake up and see you, and 
		although many times you say I make fun of you when I repeat 
		the things you say, or copy your phrases, I do it because 
		I love you so so much, and I cannot do more than enjoy 
		every little thing you do. Really, those little things you 
		do are the cutest thing I have ever seen. So thanks to you, 
		everyday is amazing, every day I am happy, and everyday 
		I discover that you are the most amazing girl in the world 
		to me.

		I love you my honey bunny novia. Sweet dreams kochanie!
