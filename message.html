	Hey honey novia, another special date and another message. I don't want 
	it to be like you only receive my messages on special dates, but at 
	least you should get them on those days. I have no excuses, because I know 
	how much you like them.
	</p>


	<p>
	Today I want you to know that you are not only the most special woman in my 
	life, but also the most important person in it. Like I have told you many 
	times, I cannot believe that I found someone like you. You are the best 
	person I have known. Just like me, you are not perfect, but you are perfect 
	to me and I guess that's what matters. 
	</p>

	<p>
	You know they say that we are the people we have around us, so if I have you 
	around me, I will be the best version of myself I could be. I love the way 
	you see life, how you are happy with the simple things which are the most 
	important ones. I learn a little bit about life from you everyday my love. 
	I love you my honey bunny pony novia.
	</p>
