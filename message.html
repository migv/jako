		Hey honey novia mia. I know it's been a while, but I hope 
		you don't think that I don't care about you. I know 
		we need each other, and being far away from you is also 
		difficult for me. Living with you was so easy and so hard, 
		it was so easy to spend amazing time together, and so hard 
		to know that I can't be close to you every moment. I guess 
		that means I am happy with you :). I know I am a dreamer 
		bunny and that can be annoying sometimes, but I could not 
		imagine doing anything without you. It's not that I am used 
		to you, but it's like you are a part of me, a part of my 
		life and of everything I am. I couldn't be without you 
		after all we have lived together.
	</p> 

	<p>
		I love you and I miss you. Always and forever!
	</p>
