		Hey novia, we are very close to our new adventure and I 
		am so looking forward to making new memories with you. 
		Well, last weekend was also special, it was in a way the 
		first time that we were hosting the visit of someone as a 
		couple. Not exactly, but it did feel a bit like that.
	</p> 

	<p>
		Let's go back to our upcoming adventure. I know it's going 
		to be awesome and although I feel like I cannot give you 
		exactly the holiday that I wish I could, every experience 
		is great with you, whether we stay in the most comfortable 
		place in the world, or in the cheapest most simple 
		accommodation. Not that we will, but I am just saying, I 
		feel so comfortable with you that I would be happy 
		wherever we are, as long as I am with you. And I love that 
		about us. We have big dreams, but we will be happy no 
		matter what. Okay, we do have a pretty cool life now, so 
		I have nothing to complain really, but I was just saying, 
		I know I will be happy with you no matter what. Because 
		I love you with all my heart.
	</p> 

	<p>
		Many kisses my honey novia!
