	<h1> <a href=index.html>Message of the day (original)</a> </h1>
	<p>
         Hey novia, this time I decided to write to you in Spanish. The next phrase should be easy for you to understand:
	</p>

	<p>
         You are the most wonderful thing that happened to me in this life.
	</p>

	<p>
         I still think its incredible how our story began. It all began in my appartment, one day you simply arrived 
	 and swept me away with your smile, with that laugh that even now makes me fall in love even more every time I hear it. 
	 I remember that you were watching a movie and I would only listen how you laughed. I thought, "I love the way she laughs". 
	 And in those first days I realized how much you love to laugh, that you are a happy person, and that is something that I 
	 have always admired about you. To me you are perfect, not only because we are very much alike, but also because you have things 
	 that I do not, because in many ways I would like to be like you, and because I know that with you in my life I will get to be 
	 the best man I can be.
	</p>

	<p>
         I love you love of my life.
	</p>
