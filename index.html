<h1> Message of the day </h1>

<p>
  Hey bunny, yeah, I had to use it as you said I would. Only 2 weeks left until we can finally say we have known each other for more than one year. It has been
  such a great time with you. 
</p>

<p>
  I have to say that the most incredible part of my time with you is discovering
  how well we understand each other. Even when we argue I somehow feel that we are 
  still connected on the same goal in mind. I cannot believe that I found someone so 
  compatible with me as you are. So I am really not lying when I say that we are
   perfect. And you know what, you think the same, which comes to show how great
    we are together.
</p>


<p>
  I also love you today honey novia!

  Hey honey novia, today its eleven months since the day we met, and I am so happy to have you in my life. I thought I could remind 
  you about one of our great weekends, I am sure if you look at the photo you will know what weekend it was.
</p>

  I really cannot wait for more weekends like that together, in many different parts of the world. If it is up me, I would go 
  everywhere with you, but I know you don't like some of the cold places I would like to visit; still, wherever I go I am always 
  thinking of you. And for the rest of places; the ones that we will see together, you can always count with a kiss everytime you 
  blink. I love you honey novia.

  Good morning my honey novia. This morning I woke up and I knew I had dreamed about you, I cannot remember what was it about, but 
  I just knew you had been in my mind. It's funny how you keep getting deeper and deeper into my mind as time goes by. Eventhough 
  I already made up my mind about you months ago, you become more important to me every day and every night. There is no longer a me without 
  you, and that's the way it has to be.
</p>

<p>
  I love you this morning and I will love you this evening. That's the sentence I will repeat every day from now on. Many kisses 
  my honey novia!
</p>

  Hey honey novia, now it's only 3 days to see you again and you have no idea how happy I am and how much I miss you. I was just now thinking on how much 
  I love your laugh. I think I have told you many times that I loved 
  your laugh since the first time I heard it. I still remember because I was not by your side back then, but eventhough I didn't know you, 
  I wished I could be there with you, laugh with you, and kiss you. Yes honey novia, I wanted to kiss you since the first night I met you.
</p>

<p>
  Luckily for me, now I hear it everyday, and even several times per day. I love how I hear you laugh when I wake up and how you seem so 
  happy at night before you go to sleep and wish me good night. So just keep laughing and keep laughing with me. That makes me the happiest guy 
  in the world. I love you honey novia!
</p>

Hey honey novia, tonight I just want to tell you that I love you. I really really do, and I really want to believe that this is the most special thing in the world.
At least that's how it feels to me. I am not perfect, and you are not either, but I will do my best to make our life together perfect. Please do the same for me.
</p>

<p>
I know we deserve to have the best life, a life we could only have dreamed of. With ups and downs, sure, I hope with not so many bad things, but no matter what, if we are together, we will always have a perfect life.
I do hope life will also give us good things, after all, there are things which are not up to us. But I have hope, I have hope in us.
</p>

<p>
I love you with all my heart!
</p>

Good morning honey novia! Finally I post sometthing for you again. After two weekends with you I could not be happier with my life. Everytime I spend time with you I realize how great we will be together and I am more and more convinced that we are perfect for each other. I can not wait for the day in which I will not have to wait weeks or days to see you. 
</p>

<p>
I am so excited about our perfect life together, because with you, no matter what, life is perfect. I love you honey novia!

  This time the message is inspired by a phrase you just said to me as I began to write this new entry. You said: don't loose me. Of course I do not plan to loose you 
  my honey novia. You are the best thing in the world to me and I want to have you always close to me. I know you say it as a joke everytime my phone falls off as we speak on skype 
  and I hope that's the only time you will say it. I love you with all my heart and as we always say: you are stuck with me, so, no novia, I am not going to loose you, not 
  today, not ever.
</p>

Hey honey novia. You know they say that the best relationships are the ones where both people tell each other what they think.
I love when you remind me about these messages, and the fact that sometimes it might take me a bit longer to write them, does not mean I have forgotten about you, but I love when you ask me about your message.
I do not mind that you do and I hope you do not mind doing it. I hope you always ask me to do nice things for you. I will do them with or without you telling me, but it is great to know that you 
will not let me not make you happy. And making you happy makes me simply the happiest guy in the world.
</p>

<p>
I love you my honey novia.

Now it has been a few days since my last message, but the fact that I was busy does not mean I stopped thinking of you.
Besides, I got to see you over the weekend and if I am completely honest with you, I have the best days of my life everytime I am with you. 
So I have come to the conclusion that every day that I am with you is the best day of my life. Thanks for making my days and my life so amazing.
</p>

<p>
Many kisses my honey novia.

One more day,one more message, not sure that I will be able to post something here every day, but as long as I can, why not do it.
What I can do is try to talk to you every single day, at least one "Hi honey novia", but don't leave you one day without hearing from me.
Okay, it might be that at some point I will be in some crazy place and I can't talk to you, so that's why I should take advantage of every time I can.
My plan is for you to never forget how I feel about you. Not one single day, because every single day I am loving you. 

I love you today honey novia.
</p>

<!-- My first message and I wonder what to say.
I told you it would not be easy, so many things I could tell and so many that I already have.
I could tell you that today I woke up and thought about you, but you probably know that already. Hmm, what if I tell you that I dreamed about you last night.
Too obvious too. What about the fact that I am thinking about you right now (again too obvious).
I know! what is not so obvious is that one week from now, one month from now, one year from now, and hopefully 20 years from now I will still wake up and think about you.
I will still dream about you and I will still think about you when I will send you a message to tell you how I feel about you.*/

/*Have a good day my honey novia.*/ -->
