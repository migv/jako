My first message and I wonder what to say.
I told you it would not be easy, so many things I could tell and so many that I already have.
I could tell you that today I woke up and thought about you, but you probably know that already. Hmm, what if I tell you that I dreamed about you last night.
Too obvious too. What about the fact that I am thinking about you right now (again too obvious).
I know! what is not so obvious is that one week from now, one month from now, one year from now, and hopefully 20 years from now I will still wake up and think about you.
I will still dream about you and I will still think about you when I will send you a message to tell you how I feel about you.

Have a good day my honey novia.
