<h1> Message of the day </h1>

<p>
Now it has been a few days since my last message, but the fact that I was busy does not mean I stopped thinking of you.
Besides, I got to see you over the weekend and if I am completely honest with you, I have the best days of my life everytime I am with you. 
So I have come to the conclusion that every day that I am with you is the best day of my life. Thanks for making my days and my life so amazing.
</p>

<p>
Many kisses my honey novia.

One more day,one more message, not sure that I will be able to post something here every day, but as long as I can, why not do it.
What I can do is try to talk to you every single day, at least one "Hi honey novia", but don't leave you one day without hearing from me.
Okay, it might be that at some point I will be in some crazy place and I can't talk to you, so that's why I should take advantage of every time I can.
My plan is for you to never forget how I feel about you. Not one single day, because every single day I am loving you. 

I love you today honey novia.

<!-- My first message and I wonder what to say.
I told you it would not be easy, so many things I could tell and so many that I already have.
I could tell you that today I woke up and thought about you, but you probably know that already. Hmm, what if I tell you that I dreamed about you last night.
Too obvious too. What about the fact that I am thinking about you right now (again too obvious).
I know! what is not so obvious is that one week from now, one month from now, one year from now, and hopefully 20 years from now I will still wake up and think about you.
I will still dream about you and I will still think about you when I will send you a message to tell you how I feel about you.*/

/*Have a good day my honey novia.*/ -->
